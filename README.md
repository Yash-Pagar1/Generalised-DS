# Technology: C++ Programming

# Project Overview : 

- This project is a C++ library of generic data structures that provides object-oriented implementations of both linear and non-linear data structures.
  
- It offers ready-to-use functionalities for fundamental as well as advanced operations, designed in a generic way using templates so that they can be reused with any data type.
  
- The library is designed to support clean OOP principles, modularity, and extensibilityâ€”making it suitable for both academic learning and real-world application development.

# Key Features :

- Linear Data Structures
- Singly Linear Linked List
- Singly Circular Linked List
- Doubly Linear Linked List
- Doubly Circular Linked List
- Stack (LIFO)
- Queue (FIFO)
- 
# Non-Linear Data Structures :
- Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert, delete, traversal operations
  
# Algorithms :
- Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search etc)
- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort etc)
  
# Generic Implementation :
- Uses C++ templates for data type independence.
- Same implementation works for integers, floats, strings, and custom objects.
  
# Library Format :
- Designed as a reusable C++ library that can be linked with client applications.

# Learning Outcomes : 
- Mastery of C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- Strong foundation in linear and non-linear data structures.
- Implementation of generic programming with templates.
- Practical knowledge of searching and sorting algorithms.
- Experience in designing reusable libraries for software development.
